    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Not all users receive the same offer, and that is the challenge to solve with this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to combine transaction, demographic and offer data to determine **which demographic groups respond best to which offer type**. This data set is a simplified version of the real Starbucks app because the underlying simulator only has one product whereas Starbucks actually sells dozens of products.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every offer has a validity period before the offer expires. As an example, a BOGO offer might be valid for only 5 days. You'll see in the data set that informational offers have a validity period even though these ads are merely providing information about a product; for example, if an informational offer has 7 days of validity, we can assume the customer is feeling the influence of the offer for 7 days after receiving the advertisement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transactional data showing user purchases made on the app including the timestamp of purchase and the amount of money spent on a purchase is given. This transactional data also has a record for each offer that a user receives as well as a record for when a user actually views the offer. There are also records for when a user completes an offer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind as well that someone using the app might make a purchase through the app without having received an offer or seen an offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To give an example, a user could receive a discount offer buy 10 dollars get 2 off on Monday. The offer is valid for 10 days from receipt. If the customer accumulates at least 10 dollars in purchases during the validity period, the customer completes the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a few things to watch out for in this data set. Customers do not opt into the offers that they receive; in other words, a user can receive an offer, never actually view the offer, and still complete the offer. For example, a user might receive the \"buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer\", but the user never opens the offer during the 10 day validity period. The customer spends 15 dollars during those ten days. There will be an offer completion record in the data set; however, the customer was not influenced by the offer because the customer never viewed the offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data cleaning especially important and tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to take into account that some demographic groups will make purchases even if they don't receive an offer. From a business perspective, if a customer is going to make a 10 dollar purchase without an offer anyway, we wouldn't want to send a buy 10 dollars get 2 dollars off offer. We'll want to try to assess what a certain demographic group will buy when not receiving any offers.\n"

    "There were a few challenges that were faced in this project. Initially we discovered that the data were inconsistent for example for the age. Some of the customer's have very high value in age(118 years old) which could be some default value passed in the system when customer didn't entered their age when registering. This customers also have missing values for other main attributes. So, instead of taking this data in which would cause a bias result, we removed them. The percentage of them were about 13% from the total unique customers that we have. Removing this has reduced our dataset size which reduced our training sets too. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other inconsistency in data we found is in th eportfolio dataframe where there are *offer_id* and *offer id* in the same *value* column. So these are the small things that we need to clean up prior to analysing the dataset which if not, it may impact our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, whenever a customer made a transaction, the transaction could not be link to whether the customer using the voucher or not. Let say if you can get this information, we can trace to the offer and find out which offer bring the higher revenue to the company. \n",

    "__Ideas for Improvements__\n",

    "* There are many other attributes to explore in the EDA part. For example solving queries related to the channels(either web, mobile or social media) used in distributing offers, duration and membership.\n",
